Well done! Having spent years analyzing financial records for big banks, you've finally scratched your idealistic itch and joined the education sector. In your latest role, you've become the Chief Data Scientist for your city's school district. In this capacity, you'll be helping the  school board and mayor make strategic decisions regarding future school budgets and priorities.
As a first task, you've been asked to analyze the district-wide standardized test results. You'll be given access to every student's math and reading scores, as well as various information on the schools they attend. Your responsibility is to aggregate the data to and showcase obvious trends in school performance.
Your final report should include each of the following:

District Summary
School Summary
Top Performing Schools (By % Overall Passing)
Bottom Performing Schools (By % Overall Passing)
Math Scores by Grade
Reading Scores by Grade
Scores by School Spending
Scores by School Size
Scores by School Type

Observable Trends

The data provided explains a few observable trends in collection of the district-wide standardized test results from 9th to 12th graders which will help the school board and mayor make strategic decisions regarding future school budgets and priorities. 

  - Analyzing the % of Overall Passing, Charter Schools make up the top 5 performing schools while the bottom 5 performing schools are all District Schools. This data is consistent when scores are characterized by school type as well. (Charter: 90% Overall Pasing, District: 54% Overall Passing)
  
  - When schools are categorized by their size (small, medium, and large), Large school perform significantly lower than Small and Medium schools. Although very close to suggest any significant changes, Medium schools has a higher overall passing rate than Small schools
  
  - Suprisingly, school performances based on the average Spending Per Student, the higher a school spends per student, the lower their overall passing rate is. The lower a school spends per student results in higher overall passing.

  - Across all School Types, Spending Per Student, and Size, all grades perform better in reading than they do in math. 
  
  - Reviewing the summary of Schools by type, Charter Schools out perform District Schools. District Schools has a small difference in reading scores. The largest difference between Charter Schools and District schools is the Percentage os students Passing Math. (Charter Schools: 94%, District Schools: 67%)
